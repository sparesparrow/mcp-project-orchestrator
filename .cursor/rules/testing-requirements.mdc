# Testing Requirements for OpenSSL FIPS Development

## FIPS Testing Standards
**For FIPS module changes:**
- Every security fix requires corresponding regression test
- FIPS module changes require additional self-tests with Known Answer Tests (KAT)
- Include fuzzing test cases for new parsers and input handlers
- Run integration tests before committing any FIPS-related changes
- Validate self-tests run automatically on module load

## Coverage Requirements
**Code coverage standards:**
- Critical security functions must have 100% branch coverage
- FIPS self-tests must cover all approved algorithms completely
- Include negative test cases for error conditions and edge cases
- Test boundary conditions and input validation thoroughly
- Maintain coverage reports for security auditing

## Test Organization
**Structuring test suites:**
- Unit tests for individual functions and algorithms
- Integration tests for component interactions
- System tests for end-to-end FIPS validation
- Performance tests for cryptographic operations
- Stress tests for memory and resource handling

## Test Automation
**CI/CD integration:**
- Run full test suite on every commit
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Automated FIPS validation in CI pipelines
- Test result reporting and tracking
- Fail CI on test failures or coverage drops

## Security Testing
**Additional security validation:**
- Fuzz testing for input handling robustness
- Memory leak detection and analysis
- Thread safety testing under load
- Side-channel attack testing (timing, power analysis)
- Cryptographic correctness validation against reference implementations
