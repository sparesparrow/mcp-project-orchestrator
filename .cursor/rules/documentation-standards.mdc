# Documentation Standards for OpenSSL FIPS Development

## Code Documentation Requirements
**When documenting code:**
- Update CHANGES.md for all user-visible changes with security implications noted
- Document API changes in doc/man3/ with complete parameter descriptions
- Include code examples for new functions showing secure usage patterns
- Link to relevant RFCs and standards in documentation
- Document security considerations and limitations

## Security Documentation
**For security-critical components:**
- Document threat models for new features and major changes
- Include security considerations in design documents and code reviews
- Maintain FIPS security policy documentation with approval references
- Document algorithm limitations and constraints clearly
- Provide migration guides for security-related API changes

## API Documentation Standards
**For public interfaces:**
- Complete parameter documentation with types, ranges, and validation rules
- Document return values and error conditions comprehensively
- Include security warnings for functions handling sensitive data
- Provide usage examples with security best practices
- Document thread safety guarantees and requirements

## FIPS Documentation
**FIPS-specific requirements:**
- Document FIPS approval status for all implemented algorithms
- Include FIPS boundary definitions and crossing points
- Document self-test implementations and validation procedures
- Maintain FIPS security policy references and compliance statements
- Document non-FIPS fallback behaviors when applicable

## Developer Documentation
**For internal development:**
- Document build and test procedures for FIPS configurations
- Include troubleshooting guides for common FIPS issues
